1) Clone github repo by going to repo page.
    Under the button [<> CODE] copy the HTTPS link and in visual studo type "git clone (LINK HERE)" where you would like the repo copy to be on your machine.

    where the "Latest LTS Version: 18.15.0 (includes npm 9.5.0)" was the one I downloaded.

3) Next is Mongo. I am installing the GUI support. Go to https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass. Downoad compass (I got v1.36.2).
